<p>The Move Ascension Initiative is a multi-million dollar transportation infrastructure improvement program developed to safely move traffic within Ascension Parish. During the Master Transportation Planning Development phase, a list of Quick Start projects was identified and further separated into two phases. The Quick Start Projects, dubbed the Immediate Action Projects (IAP), were further prioritized with the help of Ascension Parish’s Program Management Consultant. On August 17th, 2017 Ascension Parish President Kenny Matassa requested Parish Council approval to move forward with all pre-construction activities associated with Quick Start – Immediate Action Projects.</p>

<p>On September 7, 2017, the first design task order was issued to begin work on the first of the Immediate Action Projects with a pre-construction deadline of December 2018.</p>

<p>It is the goal of this administration to start construction activities on the IAPs by the first quarter of 2019.</p>

<p>The Transportation &amp; Engineering Department has issued design task orders for 18 projects that are funded through to construction.  Please view the Projects page to view all MA projects in addition to task orders issued for traffic flow improvements.</p>

<hr />

<p>Below are answers to several questions we frequently receive about the Move Ascension program. If your question is not listed, we invite you to submit it via the Contact page.</p>

<h2 id="1-what-is-a-safety-widening">1. What is a Safety Widening?</h2>

<p>Upgrading the existing roadway cross section by increasing lane width, adding appropriate shoulders and drainage ditch reconfiguration to provide a safer travel experience.</p>

<h2 id="2-what-is-the-pre-construction-phase">2. What is the Pre-Construction Phase?</h2>

<p>Within the project life cycle, the goal of the Pre-Construction Phase is to design a 100% complete set of Plans and Specifications that are ready to be bid.  In order to get to the bid phase, there is a substantial amount of work that goes into developing the final design plans and specifications for a roadway project.  Some of the tasks associated with getting to the final design include: topographic survey, Subsurface Utility Engineering(SUE), geotechnical design, utility coordination, property surveys, right of way (R/W) map development, R/W acquisition, utility relocation and project permitting.</p>

<h2 id="3-can-you-explain-the-differences-between-road-repair-road-rehabilitation-and-road-reconstruction">3. Can you explain the differences between road repair, road rehabilitation and road reconstruction?</h2>

<p>Road Repair: To restore to safe condition after damage has occurred. Used for localized problems such as potholes, areas of pavement deterioration or concrete faulting. Typical repair methods include pothole filling, skin patching, partial depth patching/repair, full depth repair, or a single concrete panel repair.</p>

<p>Road Rehabilitation: To restore to near original condition. Used for distressed streets where the overall ride has degraded. Typical methods used are asphalt overlay or multiple concrete panel replacement.</p>

<p>Road Reconstruction: To comprehensively rebuild to a new condition with current criteria. Used to rebuild subgrade, roadway base, new roadway surface, roadway appurtenances, signalization, signage, marking, lighting, trees and plantings (if app), and may also include replacement of utility lines located within the road right of way.</p>

<h2 id="4-what-determines-how-an-intersection-is-improved">4. What determines how an intersection is improved?</h2>

<p>Intersections are identified for improvement by observation and the analysis of data collected in the field (i.e. peak hour traffic counts, travel times, crash history to name a few).  Once the data existing data is evaluated and problems identified, improvement alternatives are identified.  Types of improvements include providing signalization, adding turn lanes at various approaches, roundabouts, etc.  The list of improvements is further evaluated to determine which improvement provides the most benefit to the <em>traffic operations</em> (reduction in time to travel through the intersection) and safety (number of reduced crashes), which is done using traffic modeling software.  Finally, a benefit/cost value is issued to each option and the appropriate intersection improvement alternative is selected and implemented.</p>

<h2 id="5-are-my-property-taxes-dedicated-to-capital-road-improvements">5. Are my property taxes dedicated to capital road improvements?</h2>

<p>No, property taxes are not dedicated to funding transportation projects.</p>

<h2 id="6-what-local-tax-dollars-are-spent-on-road-improvements">6. What local tax dollars are spent on road improvements?</h2>

<p>Transportation improvement projects, including the Move Ascension Initiative, are funded by two-thirds (<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>) of a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>% sales tax from Sales and Use District #2, which yields between $6-7 million per year. These local tax dollars are also used for “match” contributions on state and federal projects within Ascension Parish.</p>

<h2 id="7-why-did-ascension-parish-have-to-sell-25-million-in-bonds">7. Why did Ascension Parish have to sell $25 million in bonds?</h2>

<p>In an effort to expedite the design AND construction of the Immediate Action Projects (IAPs), identified by the Transportation Department, President Matassa brought a $25 million dollar bond sale alternative to the Parish Council for approval. The proceeds from the bond sale have allowed the Move Ascension Initiative to quickly issue task orders to design consultants for all six (6) of the IAPs and two additional task orders, one for completing traffic analyses at multiple intersections as well as a Signal Timing and Synchronization task order for US 61 from Perkins Road to LA 30. This signalization effort will be implemented in the first quarter of 2018 by LA DOTD to better move traffic along US 61 throughout Ascension Parish.</p>

<h2 id="8-why-does-the-parish-have-to-pay-for-utilities-to-relocate-for-improvements">8. Why does the Parish have to pay for Utilities to relocate for improvements?</h2>

<p>Utilities are generally located in utility servitudes and not in the Parish road Right of Ways (i.e. property owned by the Parish), therefore it is the Parish’s responsibility to bear the expense of the acquisition and relocation of the utility when expanding the road Right of Way.</p>
